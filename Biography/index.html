			<p id="intro"> Alexander Fleming (Sir Alexander Fleming in full) born on August 6th, 1881 at Ayrshire, Scotland, is a physician and world-known bacteriologist who discover the lysozyme enzyme and penicillin – The first naturally-occuring antibiotic that used as treatment for pneumonia, gonorrhea, scarlet fever, diphteria, syphilis, and other diseases. The discovery and use of penicillin as antibiotic agent has saved million of lives, earned fleming together with Howard Florey and Ernst Chain (who devised methods for large-scale isolation & production of penicillin) the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology/Medicine.</p>

			<h3 class="headlines"> Time line of Sir Alexander Fleming's life:</h3>
				<ul type="square">
					<li> <strong>1881</strong> — Born in rural Lochfield, in East Ayrshire, Scotland.</li>
					<li> <strong>1895</strong> — moved to London, where he lived with his older brother, Thomas Fleming who worked as an oculist.</li>
					<li> <strong>1900</strong> — Became a private in the London Scottish Regiment.</li>
					<li> <strong>1901</strong> — Began his medical studies at St.Mary's Hospital Medical School at the University of London.</li>
					<li> <strong>1908</strong> — Won  gold medal as the top medical student. At first he planned to become a surgeon, but a temporary position in the laboratories of the Inoculation Department at St. Mary’s Hospital convinced him that his future lay in the new field of bacteriology. There he came under the influence of bacteriologist and immunologist Sir Almroth Edward Wright, whose ideas of vaccine therapy seemed to offer a revolutionary direction in medical treatment.</li>
					<li> <strong>1909</strong> — Established a private practice as a venereologist and became the first doctor to administer a drug against syphilis called arsphenamine (Salvarsan).</li>
					<li> <strong>1914</strong> — Throughout World War I, He served as ain the Army Medical Corps as a captain. He also worked as bacteriologist, studying wound infections in a makeshift lab that had been set up by Wright in Boulogne, France. Through his research there, Fleming discovered that antiseptics as the primary means to combat infections were doing more harm than good, as their diminishing effects on the body's immunity agents largely outweighed their ability to break down harmful bacteria – therefore, more soldiers were dying from antiseptic treatment than from the infections they were trying to destroy. He recommended that the wounds simply be kept clean with a mild saline solution. However his recommendations largely went unheeded.
					</li>
					<li> <strong>1915</strong> — While a captain in the Medical Corps, Fleming married Sarah Marion McElroy, and Irish Nurse. Their only son, Robert born in 1924, became a general medical practitioner.</li>
					<li> <strong>1918</strong> — Returning to St. Mary's after the war and then took on the position of assistant director of St. Mary's Inoculation Department.</li>
					<li> <strong>1921</strong> —  Discovered lysozyme, a mildly antiseptic enzyme present in body fluids. This was the first of his major discoveries.</li>
					<li> <strong>1928</strong> — Appointed as professor of bacteriology. On September 28, 1928, he returned to his laboratory after a month away with his family, and noticed that a culture of Staphylococcus aureus he had left out had become contaminated with a mold. He later identified it as a member of the Penicillium genus. He found it to be effective against all Gram-positive pathogens, which are responsible for diseases such as scarlet fever, pneumonia, gonorrhoea, meningitis and diphtheria. But, unfortunately he and two other young researchers he hired, failed to stabilize and purify penicillin. However, Fleming pointed out that penicillin had clinical potential, both in topical and injectable forms, if it could be developed properly. He Published his discovery on the <em>British Journal of Experimental Pathology.</em></li>
					<li> <strong>1940</strong> — A team of scientists from the University of Oxford, led by Howard Florey and his co-worker, Ernst Chain – after read Fleming's paper, They succesfully isolated and purified penicillin. The antibiotic eventually came into use during World War II, revolutionizing battlefield medicine and, on a much broader scale, the field of infection control.</li>
					<li> <strong>1943</strong> — Elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society.</li>
					<li> <strong>1944</strong> — He was made a Knight Bachelor by King George VI.</li>
					<li> <strong>1945</strong> — Florey, Chain and Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</li>
					<li> <strong>1946</strong> — He succeeded Almroth Edward Wright as head of St. Mary's Inoculation Department, which was renamed the Wright-Fleming Institute.</li>
					<li> <strong>1951</strong> — He became rector of Edinburgh University.</li>
					<li> <strong>1953</strong> — He married Greek microbiologist Amalia Coutsouris-Voureka after his first wife – Sarah, died in 1949</li>
					<li> <strong>1955</strong> — Dies at the age of 73. His ashes were placed in St Paul’s Cathedral.</li>
